This first experimental batch of hooch from Lar Occidentis turned out surprisingly drinkable. It started off as a flat, acidic rosé made from store-bought grape juice, but after some time it mellowed into something drier, slightly fruity and flowery, with a touch of complexity. Notes of peach? Even so, it has a funny aftertaste, and I wouldn't buy it in a store. **6/10 acceptable if you want to get drunk and nothing else is around.**

### Bottling date and notes

19-04-2025.
Straight from bucket to bottles using a coffee filter. We'll see how bad the sediment becomes.

### Fermentation time

Bubbles stopped on 12-04-2025. So 14 days, including the slow start.

### Prophecy

Bacchus himself has blessed this first experimental batch of hooch at the Lar Occidentis estate. The holy Albert Heijn 85% red grape juice along with Vinoferm Red should produce a somewhat fruity rosé. Should yield a ~11.5% ABV of which 3% was chapitalized, making it technically a Zone A wine.

### Production notes

Bubbling only started after 4 days. Temperature (~18-20 celsius) could be slightly too low for this yeast. I might also have accidentally killed some yeast through temperature shock (20c difference between activation water and hoochables).

### Storage, aging, and serving

Best served at 14-18 C. Store in a cool, dry place. No special aging expected; may need a couple of months following fermentation to lose its rough edge.

### Actual taste and suggested food pairings

#### During bottling

First decent batch of store juice wine, ever. It looks and tastes a bit like a flat rosé with some acidity. Drinkable if you're thirsty or want to get drunk. Food pairings? Anything to override this mediocre taste.

#### On 2025-06-06

Much better. It is completely dry and has a relative strong acidity. It still tastes a bit funny, but it certainly tastes somewhat fruity and I would go so far as to say it has _some_ complexity.
6/10 definitely drinkable but I wouldn't buy it in a store.
