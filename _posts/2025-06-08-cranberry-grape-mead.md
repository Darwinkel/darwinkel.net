### Bottling date and notes

### Fermentation time

TODO

### Prophecy

Should result in a flavorful and high-alcohol fruit mead. I am praying to Bacchus that it will actually have enough flavour and residual sweetness to mask the funny flavour found in the Bland Ros√©.

### Production notes

Using an already-opened pack of Vinoferm Red. According to the instructions, they should be expired. Let's hope that some of the yeasty bois are still viable. Otherwise I may have to (re)start fermentation with a new pack of yeast.

### Storage, aging, and serving
