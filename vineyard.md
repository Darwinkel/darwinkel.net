Welcome to **Lar Occidentis MMXXV**, a modest vineyard located at exactly [53.0847557° N, 6.6521161° E](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/53.0847557/6.6521161).

Nestled at the edge of the [Drentsche Aa basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drentsche_Aa), Lar Occidentis lies on a gentle slope between [nutrient-poor, fine sandy podzol soils](https://legenda-bodemkaart.bodemdata.nl/bodemclassificatie/item/podzolgronden/humuspodzolgronden/veldpodzolgronden/hn21) and the [moister, organic-rich peaty soils](https://legenda-bodemkaart.bodemdata.nl/bodemclassificatie/item/veengronden/eerdveengronden/madeveengronden/avz) near the river's historical floodplain. Our vineyard rests on humus-bearing sand with slight loamy traces - light, well-draining, and naturally acidic, which limits nutrient availability but enhances freshness in the grape. This means our vines must dig deep and work hard, drawing their character from both the dry austerity of the inland podzols and the humid microclimate of the Aa's influence. Rooting to around one to two meters, the vines are shaped as much by the soil's leanness as by its quiet complexity. What emerges is not richness, but resilience - an expression of place that is modest, fresh, unmistakably northern, and part of the [National Park Drentsche Aa](https://www.drentscheaa.nl/kaart/).

Twenty-five cuttings of Cabernet Cantor on an SO 4 rootstock were planted on [April 25th, 2025](/vineyard-pics).
Until those are ripe for harvest, the estate produces the finest hooches, which are listed below.

The name _Lar Occidentis_ refers to the name of the area, [Westlaren](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlaren). A Lar is [a Roman household spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lares), which is also the mascot of the estate. As a highly inflected language, the [conjugation _occidentis_ (genitive third-declension noun)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/occidens) grammatically expresses _of the west_. _Lar Occidentis_, then, is the _Household Spirit of the West_.
Why Latin, you ask? It reflects the quality and authenticity of the nondescript fermented substances concocted on the premises by the Venerable Archfermenter, the Supreme Hoocher. Yes, we also ferment store-bought juice. No, we're not ashamed.

The _Lar Occidentis_ estate is approved and recognized by no known wine authority or chamber of commerce.

## Hooch batches

The lot number is the date of the start of a fermentation unless otherwise noted. It includes an index number for each fermentation vessel, if multiple.

In principle, all produced wine and hooch contains negligible amounts of fats, proteins, and salt. The wine and hooch generally contains between 75 and 95 kcal of energy per 100 ml from alcohol and residual sugars.
