Welcome to **Lar Occidentis MMXXV**, a modest vineyard located at exactly [53.0847557° N, 6.6521161° E](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/53.0847557/6.6521161).
The vineyard is located on a piece of sloped _fijnzandig zwak lemig veldpodzolgrond_ right next to the [Drentsche Aa river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drentsche_Aa) and [National Park](https://www.drentscheaa.nl/kaart/).
Twenty-five cuttings of Cabernet Cantor on an SO 4 rootstock were planted on [April 25th, 2025](/art).
Until those are ripe for harvest, the estate produces the finest hooches, which are listed below.

The name _Lar Occidentis_ refers to the name of the area, [Westlaren](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlaren). A Lar is [a Roman household spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lares), which is also the mascot of the estate. As a highly inflected language, the [conjugation _occidentis_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/occidentis) grammatically expresses _of the west_. _Lar Occidentis_, then, is the _Household Spirit of the West_.
Why Latin, you ask? It reflects the quality and authenticity of the nondescript fermented substances concocted on the premises by the Venerable Archfermenter, the Supreme Hoocher.

The _Lar Occidentis_ estate is approved and recognized by no known wine authority or chamber of commerce.

## Hooch batches

The lot number is the date of the start of a fermentation unless otherwise noted. It includes an index number for each fermentation vessel, if multiple.

In principle, all produced wine and hooch contains negligible amounts of fats, proteins, and salt. The wine and hooch generally contains between 75 and 95 kcal of energy per 100 ml from alcohol and residual sugars.
