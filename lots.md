Lot number is the date of fermentation start unless otherwise noted. It includes an index number for each fermentation vessel, if multiple.

In principle, all produced wine and hooch contains negligible amounts of fats, proteins, and salt. The wine and hooch generally contains between 75 and 95 kcal of energy per 100 ml from alcohol and unfermented sugars.

- 200g table sugar

No sulfites.

### Bottling date and notes

19-04-2025.
Straight from bucket to bottles using a coffee filter. We'll see how bad the sediment becomes.

### Fermentation time

Bubbles stopped on 12-04-2025. So 14 days, including the slow start.

### Prophecy

Bacchus himself has blessed this first experimental batch of hooch at the Lar Occidentis estate. The holy Albert Heijn 85% red grape juice along with Vinoferm Red should produce a somewhat fruity rosé. Should yield a ~11.5% ABV of which 3% was chapitalized, making it technically a Zone A wine.

### Production notes

Bubbling only started after 4 days. Temperature (~18-20 celsius) could be slightly too low for this yeast. I might also have accidentally killed some yeast through temperature shock (20c difference between activation water and hoochables).

### Storage, aging, and serving

Best served at 14-18 C. Store in a cool, dry place. No special aging expected; may need a couple of months following fermentation to lose its rough edge.

### Actual taste and suggested food pairings

#### During bottling

First decent batch of store juice wine, ever. It looks and tastes a bit like a flat rosé with some acidity. Drinkable if you're thirsty or want to get drunk.

#### On 2025-06-06

Much better. It is completely dry and has a relative strong acidity. It still tastes a bit funny, but it certainly tastes somewhat fruity and I would go so far as to say it has _some_ complexity.
6/10 definitely drinkable but I wouldn't buy it in a store.

### Prophecy

Should result in a flavorful and high-alcohol fruit mead. I am praying to Bacchus that it will actually have enough flavour and residual sweetness to mask the funny flavour found in the Bland Rosé.

### Production notes

Using an already-opened pack of Vinoferm Red. According to the instructions, they should be expired. Let's hope that some of the yeasty bois are still viable. Otherwise I may have to (re)start fermentation with a new pack of yeast.
